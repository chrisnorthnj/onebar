# Onebar

This is a node app based on scotch-io's node-todo example app.  
This is largely an exercise for me to learn node.js, but also has some functional ambition as well.
## Requirements

- [Node and npm](http://nodejs.org)
- MongoDB: Make sure you have your own local or remote MongoDB database URI configured in `config/database.js`

More notes to follow.  For now, Thanks very much to scotch-io for the excellent examples.
